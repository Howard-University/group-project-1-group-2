We are Group 2: Rianna McDuffus(Leader), Najae Batts, Sijan Shrestha, and Alana Manuel. Once learning about the group project that we were assigned, we searched on kaggle for datasets and decided as a group on Sleep and Health Statistics. This was important to us because we all thought, as college students, the variety of sleep schedules and patterns we have. We sought to better understand the correlation of how factors presented in the dataset (dietary habits, exercise, medication, etc.) interact with sleep. The goal of our project was to find interactions between sleep time, physical activity, and dietary habits, looking specifically at those close to our age. This would help us better understand how these aspects affect sleep quality and can differ between the genders. As for responsibilities: We all loaded the data, Alana did the Basic Numpy Operations, Najea handled data cleaning, Rianna complete the data filtering, selection, sorting, and ranking, and Sijan managed the grouping and aggregation. We all completed the presentation and short report together, both of which are included here. In the presentation we went over our process going through the data and an analysis of the information we found along the way. The short report provides a more detailed explanation of this process as well as some of our opninions on the limitations of the dataset.

The dataset that we chose overall had good quality and was interesting to look at. However, the datasetâ€™s small size may raise concern about the statistical significance when attempting to generalize findings. The absence of geographical data also leaves out the potential environmental influences on health and sleep. Furthermore incorporating mental health data, including stress levels and mood, could enhance the understanding of sleep disorder and quality. A large dataset would help improve the analysis in the real world. The categorical variables like Physical Activity Level and Dietary Habits can also be broken down into granular categories to facilitate more detailed quantitative analysis.
